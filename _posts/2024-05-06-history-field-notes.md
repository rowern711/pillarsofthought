Walking the same road twice never feels identical. This entry tracks how places carry their own footnotes—monuments, graffiti, altered storefronts—that keep score of what a community tried to forget or remember.

The goal is to invite slow looking: pause at the details, ask who put them there, and map how yesterday's edits set the stage for today's debates.
