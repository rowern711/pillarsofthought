Policy starts in prototypes. Run the pilot, measure something real, and adjust before you harden the rules. This note maps the ingredients of a good trial: short timeline, clear success metrics, and room to backtrack without embarrassment.

By focusing on small circles of impact first, the playbook keeps the upside visible while the costs stay contained.
